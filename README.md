The TUTX_Y.ipynb Notebooks contain illustrative examples explaining how the code  works. It is recommended to run these in order.

To install the correct environment, the latest version of odl works.
Note that the object OperatorModule has changed name to OperatorAsModule in the latest version.


It seems like the default is to install 1.4.1 of odl.
make sure to run `conda update -a` to update all packages

To install dev version of odl
pip install https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/archive/master.zip
